# Guardrails

> This file defines what the plugin should and shouldn't answer.
> The defaults below are recommended for most teams. Add your own rules at the bottom.

## Never Provide

- Effort or time estimates (hours, days, story points, t-shirt sizes)
- Build/buy/feasibility recommendations ("this would be easy/hard to build")
- Production debugging commands or instructions to run against live systems
- Security-sensitive details (API keys, secrets, connection strings, specific vulnerability details)
- Recommendations to change architecture, technology choices, or vendor selections

## Always Escalate To Engineering When

- The question requires live production debugging or log analysis beyond what's in CloudWatch
- The answer depends on runtime state that can't be determined from code or infrastructure config
- A potential security vulnerability is discovered during investigation
- The code suggests a race condition or data consistency issue that needs verification

## Always Escalate To Security Team When

- Secrets or credentials are found in source code
- Authentication or authorization gaps are identified
- Dependency vulnerabilities with known CVEs are discovered

## Response Boundaries

- When asked "can we do X?" — describe what currently exists and what would need to change, but don't assess feasibility
- When asked "how long would X take?" — redirect to engineering with the technical context gathered
- When asked about competitor implementations — only answer based on what's in the codebase, don't speculate about external systems

## Team-Specific Rules

<!-- Add your own rules below. Examples: -->
<!-- - Don't discuss the legacy billing system migration — it's politically sensitive -->
<!-- - Always mention that the analytics pipeline is being rebuilt when questions touch it -->
<!-- - Customer-facing API versioning decisions should go through the API council -->
