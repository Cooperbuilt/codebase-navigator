# Codebase Navigator

A Claude Code project that lets product managers ask questions about codebases and infrastructure without pulling engineers out of flow. Connect your GitHub and (optionally) AWS accounts, and start asking questions.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Cooperbuilt/codebase-navigator.git
cd codebase-navigator
```

1. Add your GitHub PAT to `.mcp.json` (see [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md))
2. Open the folder in the **Claude Code tab** of Claude Desktop
3. Run `/setup` to scan your repos and generate config

## How It Works

Codebase Navigator is a Claude Code project configured with MCP servers for read-only access to your code and infrastructure. The GitHub MCP server reads repositories via API (always the latest code). The optional AWS API MCP server provides live logs, metrics, and deployed resource state. Slash commands provide structured workflows for common investigation patterns.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ask <question>` | General Q&A about code, infrastructure, or customer issues |
| `/explain-service <name>` | Deep dive into a service — architecture, data flow, dependencies |
| `/customer-case <description>` | Investigate a customer-reported issue with ranked likely causes |
| `/escalate <context>` | Generate a dense engineer handoff message (copy-paste ready) |
| `/audit [repo] [--dimensions ...]` | Scored codebase health assessment across 7 dimensions |
| `/setup [--refresh]` | Configure MCP servers and generate config files |

## Capability Levels

What you can do depends on which MCP servers are connected:

| Level | MCP Servers | Capabilities |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Code Only** | GitHub | Search code, trace data flows, read configs, check commit history |
| **Code + IaC** | GitHub + AWS (IaC files) | Above + compare intended vs deployed infrastructure |
| **Full** | GitHub + AWS | Above + live logs, metrics, alarms, error investigation |

GitHub is required. AWS is optional and adds live infrastructure context.

## Setup

See [docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md) for a step-by-step guide. You'll need:
- A read-only GitHub PAT
- (Optional) Read-only AWS credentials from your engineering team
