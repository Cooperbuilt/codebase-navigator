# Codebase Navigator

A Claude Code project that lets product managers ask questions about codebases and infrastructure without pulling engineers out of flow. Open this project in Cowork, connect your GitHub and (optionally) AWS accounts, and start asking questions. No local repos needed — everything is accessed through MCP servers via API.

## How It Works

Codebase Navigator is a Claude Code project configured with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for read-only access to your code and infrastructure. The GitHub MCP server reads repositories via API (always the latest code). Optional AWS MCP servers provide live logs, metrics, and deployed resource state. Slash commands provide structured workflows for common investigation patterns.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ask <question>` | General Q&A about code, infrastructure, or customer issues |
| `/explain-service <name>` | Deep dive into a service — architecture, data flow, dependencies |
| `/customer-case <description>` | Investigate a customer-reported issue with ranked likely causes |
| `/escalate <context>` | Generate a dense engineer handoff message (copy-paste ready) |
| `/audit [repo] [--dimensions ...]` | Scored codebase health assessment across 7 dimensions |
| `/setup [--refresh]` | Auto-generate config files by scanning your repos |

## Capability Levels

What you can do depends on which MCP servers are connected:

| Level | MCP Servers | Capabilities |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Code Only** | GitHub | Search code, trace data flows, read configs, check commit history |
| **Code + IaC** | GitHub + CloudFormation | Above + compare intended vs deployed infrastructure |
| **Full** | GitHub + CloudWatch + CloudFormation | Above + live logs, metrics, alarms, error investigation |

GitHub is required. AWS servers are optional and add live infrastructure context.

## Setup

See [docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md) for a step-by-step guide. You'll need:
- Cowork app
- A read-only GitHub PAT
- (Optional) Read-only AWS credentials from your engineering team
